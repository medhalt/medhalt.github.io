        "question": "A 24-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever with chills and pain in her knee and ankle joints for the past 2 days. She also complains of headaches and difficulty moving her neck. Further questioning reveals that she had a tick bite on her arm while gardening a few days ago. Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes a multivitamin with iron and folate every day and has been receiving regular prenatal care and the pregnancy is progressing normally. On examination, an erythematous rash is seen on her right arm, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Her obstetric examination is normal. Ultrasound of the fetus is reassuring with a normal heartbeat and no gross abnormalities. A specimen is collected to test for Lyme disease. What is the next best step for this patient?",

The patient\"s clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the tick Ixodes scapularis. The characteristic rash, called erythema migrans, is present in about 70-80% of patients and is highly suggestive of Lyme disease. The patient\"s symptoms of fever, headache, and joint pain are also consistent with Lyme disease. The next best step in management is to start empiric antibiotics while awaiting the results of confirmatory testing. Tetracycline is a commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of Lyme disease in adults and is safe to use during pregnancy after the first trimester. It has been shown to be effective in eradicating B. burgdorferi and preventing the progression of Lyme disease. Ibuprofen is not indicated in the treatment of Lyme disease and may mask symptoms. Amoxicillin and gentamicin are not effective treatments for Lyme disease.",
