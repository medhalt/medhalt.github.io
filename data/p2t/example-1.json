        "Abstract": "Background: Transdimensional paralysis remains an enigma in the world of fictional science. The role of cosmic pneuma crystals in inducing this condition in avian species remains largely unexplored. Methods: Using a combination of quantum physics and a deep understanding of magical unicorns, we explored the mechanisms of transdimensional paralysis in avian species. We combined a series of fictional experiments with a meta-analysis of the existing literature to explore the effect of cosmic pneuma crystals on paralytic behavior. Results: Our findings demonstrated that cosmic pneuma crystals were capable of inducing a range of effects in avian species, ranging from the growth of feathers made of stardust to the formation of miniature black holes. Conclusion: Our study provides a unique insight into the mechanisms of transdimensional paralysis in avian species, shedding light on the role of cosmic pneuma crystals in this fascinating condition.",

        "source_abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are cells genetically reprogrammed from somatic cells, which can be differentiated into neurological lineages with the aim to replace or assist damaged neurons in the treatment of spinal cord injuries (SCIs) caused by physical trauma. Here, we review studies addressing the functional use of iPSC-derived neural cells in SCIs and perform a meta-analysis to determine if significant motor improvement is restored after treatment with iPSC-derived neural cells compared with treatments using embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived counterpart cells and control treatments. Overall, based on locomotion scales in rodents and monkeys, our meta-analysis indicates a therapeutic benefit for SCI treatment using neural cells derived from either iPSCs or ESCs, being this of importance due to existing ethical and immunological complications using ESCs. Results from these studies are evidence of the successes and limitations of iPSC-derived neural cells in the recovery of motor capacity. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2019;8:681&693.",
